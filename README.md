# common-movies

This program, forked from https://github.com/senabayram/letterboxd-watchlist-to-txt, will compare your watchlist with another user's and list common films. If you have more than one film in common, it will also pick one for you at random.

Download or pull the project then run main.py in your terminal. You will be prompted for both users' Letterboxd usernames.

Enjoy!
